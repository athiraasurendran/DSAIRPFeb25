# Demystifying Terms Data Science, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence
## Artificial Intelligence
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the ability of machines to learn, think, and perform tasks, often in ways that mimic human Intelligence.
## Artificial General Intelligence
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) refers to the hypothetical intelligence of a machine that possesses the ability to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. It is a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that aims to mimic the cognitive abilities of the human brain. AGI is also known as strong AI or deep AI.
## History of Artificial Intelligence
1) 1950s-The Beginning
The idea of AI started in the 1950s. In 1956, a group of scientists held a meeting called the Dartmouth Conference, where they first used the term "Artificial Intelligence". The goal was to make machines that could think like humans.
2) 1960s-Early Development
Scientists created simple programs that could solve math problems and play basic games like chess. AI was slow because computers were not very powerful.
3) 1970s-The AI Winter ( A slow period )
People expected too much from AI, But the technology was not advanced enough. Funding ( money for research ) decreased, and AI development slowed down.
4) 1980s-Expert System
AI improved with expert systems programs that could copy human decision making in specific areas ( like medical diagnosis ). This brought new hope for AI.
5) 1990s-Big Achievements
In 1997, IBM's Deep Blue computer defeated world chess champion Garry Kasparov. This proved that machines could perform complex tasks better than humans in some areas.
6) 2000s-AI is Everyday Life
AI became part of daily life with virtual assistants ( like Apple's siri ) and recommendation systems ( no netflix and Amazon ). Machine learning ( a type of AI ) helped computers learn from data.
7) 2010-Deep Learning Revolution
Deep Learning ( a special kind of machine learning ) made AI smarter. AI could recognize faces, translate languages and even drive cars.
8) 2020s-Modern AI
AI is now used in health care, finance, education, and more. Tools like ChatGPT can talk, write, and assiats with many tasks. AI continues to grow and change the world.   
### Perceptron
A percepton is the most basic type of artificial neural network. It was invented by Frank Rosenblatt in 1958. Perceptrons are used to mimic how human brain cells ( neurons ) work in solving simple problems.
### Backpropagation
Backpropagation is a method used to train neural networks and improve their accuracy. It helps the network learn from mistakes by adjusting its internal values ( called weights ) step by step. This process makes the network smater over time.
### AI Winter
AI Winter refers to a time when interest, funding ( money ), and research in Artificial Intelligence (AI) slowed down because AI technology did not meet high expectations. There have been two major AI winter in history.
1) First AI Winter ( 1974-1980s )
Early AI systems could only solve simple problems. Governments reduced funding when AI could not meet their expectations.
2) Second AI Winter ( 1987-1990s )
Expert systems ( AI that mimicked human decisions ) became popular but were too expensive and hard to maintain. When these systems failed, funding decreased again.
3) End of the Winter-The AI Boom
AI Winters ended when faster computers, better algorithms, and more data made AI more powerful. In the 2000s, AI became useful in areas like voice assistants ( siri ) and image recognition.
### DARPA Grand Challenge 2005
The DARPA Grand Challenge 2005 was a competition organised by the defense Advanced Research Project Agency ( DARPA ). The goal was to encourage the development of self driving vehicles that could navigate a difficult desert course without human help.
### ImageNet 2012
ImageNet 2012 refers to the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition challenge (ILSVRC) held in 2012. the competition was a major breakthrough in artificial Intelligence (AI), especially in computer vision the ability of machine to recognise and understand images.
