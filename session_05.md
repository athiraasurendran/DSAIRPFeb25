# Demystifying Terms Data Science, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence
## Artificial Intelligence
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the ability of machines to learn, think, and perform tasks, often in ways that mimic human Intelligence.
## Artificial General Intelligence
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) refers to the hypothetical intelligence of a machine that possesses the ability to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. It is a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that aims to mimic the cognitive abilities of the human brain. AGI is also known as strong AI or deep AI.
## History of Artificial Intelligence
1) 1950s-The Beginning
The idea of AI started in the 1950s. In 1956, a group of scientists held a meeting called the Dartmouth Conference, where they first used the term "Artificial Intelligence". The goal was to make machines that could think like humans.
2) 1960s-Early Development
Scientists created simple programs that could solve math problems and play basic games like chess. AI was slow because computers were not very powerful.
3) 1970s-The AI Winter ( A slow period )
People expected too much from AI, But the technology was not advanced enough. Funding ( money for research ) decreased, and AI development slowed down.
4) 1980s-Expert System
AI improved with expert systems programs that could copy human decision making in specific areas ( like medical diagnosis ). This brought new hope for AI.
5) 1990s-Big Achievements
In 1997, IBM's Deep Blue computer defeated world chess champion Garry Kasparov. This proved that machines could perform complex tasks better than humans in some areas.
6) 2000s-AI is Everyday Life
AI became part of daily life with virtual assistants ( like Apple's siri ) and recommendation systems ( no netflix and Amazon ). Machine learning ( a type of AI ) helped computers learn from data.
7) 2010-Deep Learning Revolution
Deep Learning ( a special kind of machine learning ) made AI smarter. AI could recognize faces, translate languages and even drive cars.
8) 2020s-Modern AI
AI is now used in health care, finance, education, and more. Tools like ChatGPT can talk, write, and assiats with many tasks. AI continues to grow and change the world.
